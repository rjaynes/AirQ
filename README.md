# Air Quality Trends in the US

# Data:
This data was scraped from the US EPA website. It is a collection of air quality data from the years 2000-2016. It has data for four major pollutants (Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, Carbon Monoxide and Ozone). The origian dataset had 28 fields, including raw data by state and AQI (air-quality index). For my project, I focused on AQI for the pollutants. AQI has varying scales, but a lower score is always better. (i.e. A carbon monoxide AQI of 12 is much better air qualtiy than an AQI of 75.)

Here is how the original dataset looked:![data](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63068643/124906203-ceb4e100-dfb4-11eb-9f92-c8be01327945.JPG)
